# BeatBallV1
BeatBall was going to be a online soccer game where you could punch your opponents or friends to take the ownership of the ball.
The project will not countinue. However, while working on this project i have encounter and solved different problems that i have never
encountered such as skin and ragdoll system in a multiplayer game. You can still download and try to play with your friends but both graphics
and codebase are in poor condition right now.
